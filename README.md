# Emotional Support Chatbot

## Project Overview
The Emotional Support Chatbot is designed to provide empathetic responses to users based on fine-tuned GPT-2 language models. Leveraging datasets such as `EmpatheticDialogues`, the chatbot aims to assist individuals during challenging moments by offering meaningful and supportive conversations.

## Features
- **Pretrained Language Model**: Fine-tuned GPT-2 model adapted for empathetic dialogue.
- **Custom Dataset Integration**: Utilizes preprocessed `EmpatheticDialogues` data for training.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Interactive web interface for users to engage with the chatbot.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for easy future improvements and dataset expansion.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom-designed UI
- **Deployment**: Prototype stage on local machines, scalable for cloud deployment

## Current Status
The project is in its prototype phase, with key components for data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and frontend integration implemented. Testing and optimization are ongoing to ensure robust and meaningful responses.

## Private Repository Notice
This project is currently private and will remain confidential until its planned release in early 2025.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository (if you have access):
   ```bash
   git clone <private-repo-url>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Access the app via the local development server URL.

## Future Plans
- Extend the chatbot's language support to include Mandarin.
- Enhance the empathetic response capability using additional datasets.
- Monetize features in a secure and ethical manner.
